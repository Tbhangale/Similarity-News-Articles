Analysis of News articles using R

1. Download the news articles dataset named “20news-18828.tar.gz”, from an online textual
dataset repository: http://qwone.com/%7Ejason/20Newsgroups/. The 20 Newsgroups data set is a
collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup articles, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20
different newsgroups.

2. Convert them to a term frequency (TF) matrix. (each row is an article, each column is a unique term, and each entry of this TF matrix is term frequency).

3. Feature selection: Select top 100 best features from the data matrix.

4. Compute the similarity - Euclidean, Cosine, Jaccard - between each pair of articles. 

5. Term Frequency analysis.

6. Heatmap based similarity analysis of document pairs.

7. Analyze the correlations (degree of similarity) of Cosine-Euclidean, Euclidean-Jaccard, Jaccard - Cosine.

8. Compute Standard Deviation

9. Rank all the articles pairs in a decreasing order of similarity.
